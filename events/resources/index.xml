      <description>An Introduction to Kubeflow, the MLOps Platform on Kubernetes Summary Kubeflow is an open source, community-driven project for deploying and managing a cloud native machine learning stack on Kubernetes. Kubeflow has been around since 2017 and was recently accepted into CNCF as an Incubating project. At Melio AI, we have been deploying and supporting Kubeflow for the past 3 years. It&amp;rsquo;s our go-to stack for customers that want to run machine learning workloads in a private cloud or an on-premise set up.</description>

      <description>Optimizing Network Costs in Kubernetes Summary Nobody likes the idea of degraded performance or unscheduled downtime in their services. In many cases, the implications can be quite damaging, to say the least.&#xA;In the context of Kubernetes, many would argue that it goes against &amp;ldquo;the promise&amp;rdquo; that it&amp;rsquo;s meant to provide a container orchestration solution. That&amp;rsquo;s why teams build fault tolerance and resilience mechanisms to mitigate the risks of such issues in their environments.</description>

      <description>Synthetic Testing with Canary Checker Summary Canary Checker https://github.com/flanksource/canary-checker is an open-source, Kubernetes native health check framework that supports 3 different types of checks:&#xA;Active Application health checks involve sending periodic requests to the service or application and checking the response to ensure that it is working correctly, Active health checks are proactive and can detect issues quickly, but they can also introduce some load on the system being monitored. Active Infrastructure health checks are similar to application health checks, but instead of sending a request to the application it sends a request to the infrastructure to deploy a new application or infrastructure component e.</description>

      <description>Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter: Advanced Scheduling with Pod Affinity Summary For our August meetup, we invited Lukonde Mwila to come talk to us about Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter: Advanced Scheduling with Pod Affinity &amp;amp; Volume Topology Awareness.&#xA;One feature that draws people to Kubernetes is its ability to scale automatically. Auto-scaling Kubernetes is an essential part of your cloud-native strategy. In addition, you may be dealing with use cases requiring advanced Kubernetes scheduling requirements like pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and volume topology awareness.</description>

      <description>Cloud-native machine learning: Kubeflow success stories Summary For our June meet-up, we have scheduled a panel discussion to talk about Kubeflow: The Machine Learning Toolkit for Kubernetes. We invited cloud-native specialist Harry Lee, machine learning manager Axel Tidemann and techie-turned-CEO Marko Salic to chat about their Kubeflow success story.&#xA;Gartner estimated that 85% of companies manage their hybrid and multi-cloud ML environments with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes). Cloud-native is the de facto for AI-native companies, but it can be difficult to select the best-of-breed tools for your organisation.</description>

      <description>Transforming into a zero-bug super developer on Kubernetes Summary For our July meetup, we have Lepolesa Libete coming to explore a cool Kubernetes tool: DevSpace with us.&#xA;DevSpace helps developers build applications that run on Kubernetes. It brings the deployment environment (i.e. Kubernetes) closer to developers working on the application. This empowers developers to collaborate and discover issues early during development.&#xA;DevSpace lets you start the entire deployment workflow with a single command.</description>
