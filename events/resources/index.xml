      <description>Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter: Advanced Scheduling with Pod Affinity Summary For our August meetup, we invited Lukonde Mwila to come talk to us about Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter: Advanced Scheduling with Pod Affinity &amp;amp; Volume Topology Awareness.
One feature that draws people to Kubernetes is its ability to scale automatically. Auto-scaling Kubernetes is an essential part of your cloud-native strategy. In addition, you may be dealing with use cases requiring advanced Kubernetes scheduling requirements like pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and volume topology awareness.</description>

      <description>Cloud-native machine learning: Kubeflow success stories Summary For our June meet-up, we have scheduled a panel discussion to talk about Kubeflow: The Machine Learning Toolkit for Kubernetes. We invited cloud-native specialist Harry Lee, machine learning manager Axel Tidemann and techie-turned-CEO Marko Salic to chat about their Kubeflow success story.
Gartner estimated that 85% of companies manage their hybrid and multi-cloud ML environments with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes). Cloud-native is the de facto for AI-native companies, but it can be difficult to select the best-of-breed tools for your organisation.</description>

      <description>Transforming into a zero-bug super developer on Kubernetes Summary For our July meetup, we have Lepolesa Libete coming to explore a cool Kubernetes tool: DevSpace with us.
DevSpace helps developers build applications that run on Kubernetes. It brings the deployment environment (i.e. Kubernetes) closer to developers working on the application. This empowers developers to collaborate and discover issues early during development.
DevSpace lets you start the entire deployment workflow with a single command.</description>
