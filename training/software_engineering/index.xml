      <title>Version Control with Git and GitHub</title>

      <description>Developing software in a team without some form of version control is chaotic, confusing, and leads to inevitable human mistakes.
This workshop is geared towards software engineering and data engineering teams who have the need to work collaboratively on code projects and wish to use industry best-practices around code versioning and source control.
Although GitHub is used by default in this workshop, this can be changed to any major provider as required.</description>

      <description>When developing software solutions, automated tests are the only thing standing between a robust, reliable solution, and a brittle and frustrating experience for end-users.
This workshop focusses on the theory and practice of automated software testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
The workshop will use Python to illustrate the process of test-driven development, but this may be changed as required.
Agenda An industry expert will show (through a live-coding session) the process and benefits of both testing and TDD.</description>
